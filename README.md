# **Your Next Life Generator**

This project is a fun generator that diagnoses your next life with a single button click. The results are displayed as images in four categories: "Yourself," "Your Partner," "Your Pet," and "Your House."

## Reason for Choosing This Project

For this personal project, I wanted to learn the basics of web development in a fun and engaging way.

## How to Use

Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Click the "Diagnose" button on the screen to see your four results displayed as images.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used to build the basic structure of the website.

- JavaScript: Used to implement the core logic of the game, including random image selection and display.

- Tailwind CSS: Used for styling and creating the visual design of the project.
